## Measurements

Here are some [measurements](measurements/wq_pars_month_voice_for_nature.png) that give information about the water quality in the Tetrapond (not real actually from a sample point out side the campus but close by).
Water quality samples are relativly expensive and take time, a sollution to this would be continuous sampling like the [Pond project](https://ddw.nl/en/programme/12536/pond).

However you could also contribute yourself by taking your own samples with the [Aquality app](https://www.deltares.nl/software-en-data/producten/aquality-app)
